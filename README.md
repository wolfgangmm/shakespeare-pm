# Shakespeare's Plays: an app based on the TEI Processing Model

This application was generated automatically using the [http://showcases.exist-db.org/exist/apps/tei-simple/index.html](TEI Processing Model App Generator). The generated code has been extended to support a side-by-side display of text and facsimile of a page. A custom ODD is used to control the rendition of the plays.

No data is included in this repo, but you can get the full corpus of texts of the Bodleian First Folio of Shakespeare's plays here: http://firstfolio.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/.

Upload the XML documents into the /data subcollection and the facsimile images into /data/facs.
